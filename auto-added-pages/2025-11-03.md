The following enhancements have been made to the Mobile Endpoint Agent:

* Improved file sharing with a fallback option for Chrome OS and other devices that do not support default choosers.
* Added a mobile temperature profile feature.
* Mobile devices now support standard 1-minute tests running at 5-minute intervals, eliminating the need for separate mobile-specific tests.
