# Version Control

Keep track of changes, roll back to a previous version and moreYou can easily monitor all the changes people have made to your content using to the **Version history** side panel. Test

### Version history <a href="#see-the-activity-of-a-specific-draft" id="see-the-activity-of-a-specific-draft"></a>

In the Version history of a space, you can see a list of all the actions that changed the content within it. These include:

* When someone made [live edits](https://app.gitbook.com/o/d8f63b60-89ae-11e7-8574-5927d48c4877/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/collaboration/live-edits) to the space.
* When someone merged a [change request](https://app.gitbook.com/o/d8f63b60-89ae-11e7-8574-5927d48c4877/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/collaboration/change-requests).
* When someone performed a [Git Sync](https://app.gitbook.com/o/d8f63b60-89ae-11e7-8574-5927d48c4877/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/getting-started/git-sync) operation.

### View historical versions of content <a href="#view-historical-versions-of-content" id="view-historical-versions-of-content"></a>

To view past versions of your content and see the changes that were made, click the **Version history** button in the [space header](https://app.gitbook.com/o/d8f63b60-89ae-11e7-8574-5927d48c4877/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/resources/gitbook-ui#space-header), or open the **Actions menu** next to the space or change request title and choose **Version history**.Click on any item in the list to see how your content looked at the point this change was made. This is very similar to how you view [change requests](https://app.gitbook.com/o/d8f63b60-89ae-11e7-8574-5927d48c4877/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/collaboration/change-requests).

### Show changes <a href="#show-changes" id="show-changes"></a>

When you are viewing an old version of your content, you can choose to highlight the differences between the old and current content — similar to [diff view in a change request](https://app.gitbook.com/o/d8f63b60-89ae-11e7-8574-5927d48c4877/s/NkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X/collaboration/change-requests#diff-mode).To enable or disable this, use the **Show changes** toggle at the bottom of the **Version history** side panel.With show changes enabled, content that has changed will be highlighted by an icon on the left of its content block.

### Viewing historical published versions <a href="#viewing-historical-published-versions" id="viewing-historical-published-versions"></a>

If you're investigating the version history of a published space, you can also view previews of what the previous versions looked like in the published context (i.e. what the end user would see).You can do this by:1From the version history side panel, select the revision2Copy the ID at the end of the URL3Add it at the end of your published docs URL as `/~/revisions/<id>`

### Roll back to a previous version <a href="#roll-back-to-a-previous-version" id="roll-back-to-a-previous-version"></a>

Rolling back allows you to revert a space’s content to the way it was at a previous point in time. This is helpful if you’ve accidentally made a breaking change or deleted content and need to quickly get back to a previous version of the space.To roll back to a previous version of your space, hover over the version in the side panel, click the **Actions button** and select **Rollback**.
