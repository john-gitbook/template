### Understand Why an Alert Triggered with Adaptive Alert Explainability

To help you understand why an adaptive alert was triggered, we've introduced Adaptive Alert Explainability. The new **Why Did This Alert Trigger?** tab, available for both active and cleared adaptive alerts, provides clear insight into the system's decision-making process.

Key features:

* **View Alert Probability:** See how the system's confidence in an issue evolved over time and when it crossed your configured sensitivity threshold.
* **Compare Observed vs. Expected Anomalies:** A new graph shows the number of agents reporting anomalies compared to the system's learned baseline.
* **Visualize the Trigger Event:** Timelines highlight how metrics deviated from their expected behavior leading up to the alert.

This enhancement improves transparency by showing the data and logic behind each adaptive alert, helping you build trust in the system and take more informed action. For more information, see [Alerts](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/alerts).

### Improved Alerting Performance for Large-Scale Endpoint Agent Deployments

To improve alerting performance and reliability for large-scale Endpoint Agent tests, the Alert Details view and API will now display details for up to 500 violating agents per active alert.

Key changes:

* The Alert Details view and API now show details for a maximum of 500 agents per alert to ensure UI and API stability.
* The total number of violating agents is still displayed prominently, so you always know the full scope of an issue.
* This change prevents oversized alert payloads that could previously slow down processing when thousands of agents entered an alert state simultaneously.

This update ensures alert delivery stability and reduces load times, enhancing overall system resilience for your largest deployments. For more information about alerts, see [Alerts](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/alerts).
