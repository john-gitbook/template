### Test Version History is now available in Test Settings

You can now view and revert to previous saved versions of a test. Selecting a previous version from the drop-down list will load that configuration into the test settings form, which you can then save and enable for the test.

For more information, see [Revert to a Previous Test Version](https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/tests#reverting-to-a-previous-test-version).
