This page is about Fruit:

Fruits are the fleshy, seed-bearing structures that develop from the ovary of a flowering plant. üçé They come in an astonishing variety of shapes, sizes, colors, and flavors, ranging from the tartness of a lemon to the intense sweetness of a mango, and are generally categorized as botanical fruits (developed from the flower's ovary, like apples, tomatoes, and berries) or accessory fruits (incorporating other flower parts, like strawberries). Beyond their delicious taste, fruits are a vital part of a healthy diet, being packed with essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, making them nature's perfect, often portable, snack.
