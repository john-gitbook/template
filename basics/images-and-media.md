# Images & media

GitBook allows you to add images and media easily to your docs. Simply drag a file into the editor, or use the file manager in the upper right corner to upload multiple images at once.

<figure><img src="../getting-started/images/images-and-media.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Add alt text and captions to your images</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also add images simply by copying and pasting them directly into the editor â€” and GitBook will automatically add it to your file manager.
{% endhint %}

I'm adding a <code class="expression">space.vars.variable</code> here:

```
// Some code that is written and this is {{space.vars.variable}} a variable
```
