<summary>What is a Team Inbox?</summary>

A Team Inbox is a shared space where messages from shared accounts (email, SMS, WhatsApp, etc.) arrive. Unlike your personal Inbox, conversations in a Team Inbox aren't assigned to anyone yet. They wait there until someone claims or assigns them. Once assigned, the conversation moves to the assignee's Inbox and appears in the team's Tasks view. Archiving from a Team Inbox removes the conversation for everyone on the team.
