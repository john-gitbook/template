# Interface FAQ

### Sidebar

<details>
<summary>What shows up in my Inbox?</summary>

Your **Inbox** contains everything that needs your attention:

* An email arrives in one of your accounts
* A colleague @mentions you in a conversation
* A colleague invites you to a conversation
* A colleague posts in a conversation you're watching
* A colleague assigns you to a conversation
* A closed conversation assigned to you is reopened
* A snoozed conversation comes due
</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the difference between Inbox and All?</summary>

**Inbox** shows what needs your attention now. **All** shows your complete history across every channel: archived conversations, chats, drafts, sent items, and snoozed conversations. If you can't find something, check All.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Team Inbox?</summary>

A Team Inbox is a shared space where messages from shared accounts (email, SMS, WhatsApp, etc.) arrive. Unlike your personal Inbox, conversations in a Team Inbox aren't assigned to anyone yet. They wait there until someone claims or assigns them.

Once assigned, the conversation moves to the assignee's Inbox and appears in the team's Tasks view. Archiving from a Team Inbox removes the conversation for everyone on the team.

<summary>How can I create custom sections in the sidebar?</summary>

You can organize your sidebar by creating custom sections to group labels, views, or other items. There are two ways to create a new section:

#### Option 1: Using the "Pin to sidebar" menu

1. Click the **Pin to sidebar button**
2. At the bottom of the list, select Add custom section
3. Give your section a name

Your new section will appear in the sidebar, ready for you to organize items into it.

#### Option 2: Using drag and drop

1. Drag any label or view down to the "New section" drop zone at the bottom of the sidebar
2. Name your new section
3. Drag other items into this section to organize them

{% hint style="success" %}
Drag other items into this section to organize them. You can reorder sections at any time by dragging them up or down in the sidebar.

<summary>Can I reorder account sub-mailboxes in the sidebar?</summary>

Missive does not offer a way to manually reorder email accounts, but you can customize the description of each account in your **Accounts** settings, as shown here:

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="https://learn.missiveapp.com/assets/faq/reorder-accounts-fdb6e19b5d2430f014a8ccb2f85966dc393ca71b40aa1658f89cb4decdf10bdc.png" alt="" width="563"></figure></div>
